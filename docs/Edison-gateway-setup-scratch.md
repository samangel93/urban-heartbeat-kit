Intel Edison Gateway Setup from Scratch
=======================================

1. Download the latest version of [Ubilinux](http://www.emutexlabs.com/ubilinux).
At the time of making this guide it is
[150309](http://www.emutexlabs.com/files/ubilinux/ubilinux-edison-150309.tar.gz).
Ubilinux is a Debian version for the Edison.

    Note: 150309 is a quite old version that runs kernel version 3.10 that came
    out in June 2013. We're hoping for a newer version to be
    [released soon](http://www.emutexlabs.com/support-forums/ubilinux/84-new-ubilinux-version).
